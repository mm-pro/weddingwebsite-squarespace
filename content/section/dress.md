Please wear what would make you feel your most glamorous and sexy! There's no dress code or rules and none of us will be wearing traditional wedding dress - Hugo will be in a pink suit, and Sarah in a light green dress.

As we will be getting married on a farm in February **we encourage everyone to bring lots of layers**! There may be brief moments when we will need to go outside while barns are being rearranged, but inside the barn there is heating and a fire.
